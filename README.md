# Data-Visualization
🧠 Abstract
XYZ Corporation has partnered with UVW College to boost enrollment through data-driven marketing strategies. This project leverages U.S. Census Bureau data to identify demographic factors—such as age, gender, education, marital status, and occupation—that influence income, with a focus on individuals earning more than $50,000.

By building predictive models and generating visual insights, this project aims to segment the population into income brackets, inform marketing strategies, and develop an interactive application that recommends targeted outreach methods.

🚩 Problem Statement
UVW College wants to identify potential students by income. The main objectives are:

🔍 Analyze which demographic features most influence income.

📈 Segment individuals into two categories: <=50K and >50K.

🤖 Predict an individual's income using a machine learning model.

🎯 Support data-informed marketing strategy for higher enrollment.

📂 Dataset Summary
Source: U.S. Census Bureau (Adult Income Dataset)

Records: 32,561 individuals

Features: 15 columns

Preprocessing:

Removed fnlwgt (sampling weight)

Replaced "?" values with NaN

Cleaned categorical entries and encoded variables for modeling

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Case 1: Age vs. Income
Visualization: Box Plot

Insight: Median age of individuals earning >50K is higher—age positively correlates with income.

📌 Case 2: Education vs. Income
Visualization: Stacked Bar Chart

Insight: Higher educational attainment (Doctorate, Prof-school) leads to significantly higher income. A key "inversion point" exists around "Some-college" and "Assoc-acdm".

📌 Case 3: Marital Status & Work Hours vs. Income
Visualization: Violin Plot

Insight: "Married-civ-spouse" individuals earning >50K tend to work longer hours. Marital status strongly influences work patterns.

📌 Case 4: "Workaholic Senior" Phenomenon
Visualization: Scatter Plot (Age vs. Hours Worked)

Insight: Some individuals over 70 continue working long hours and earn >50K. Age and experience contribute to higher income.

📌 Case 5: Workclass vs. Marital Status
Visualization: Heatmap

Insight: "Private" workclass dominates. Married individuals are more prevalent in higher-paying workclasses like "Federal-gov".

📌 Case 6: Racial Disparities in Workclass & Income
Visualization: Heatmap & Grouped Bar Chart

Insight: White individuals dominate the >50K income group. Black and other minority groups are underrepresented in higher income brackets.
